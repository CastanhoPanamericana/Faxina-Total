## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Muted blue (#5B85AA) to represent cleanliness and water, providing a calming feel.
- Background color: Very light desaturated blue (#E8F0F6), close to white, to provide a clean backdrop that contrasts gently with the primary.
- Accent color: Pale yellow (#D0B45A), approximately 30 degrees away from blue in the HSL color wheel, to draw attention to key elements.
- Headline font: 'Playfair' serif with a high-end feel; Body font: 'PT Sans' sans-serif that is a modern, versatile choice, and works well with 'Playfair'.
- Use simple, intuitive icons for the timer, score, and medal, ensuring they are easily recognizable and match the cartoon style.
- The cleaning area will be the primary focus, with a clear display of the timer and score. Medal will be prominently shown upon completion.
- Subtle animation will accompany the sponge, the cleaning action, the countdown timer, and the award of the medal.
